Unity editor tool that lets you generate light cookies and simulate shadows... fresh out of the oven (i'm sorry)

## Light Cookie Generator

**By**: @Simoxus ([GitHub](https://github.com/Simoxus), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@simoxusofficial))

**Thanks to**: @spazi (who made me think about making this in the first place)

## Usage
**1.** On the main page of the repository, you should see a green "Code" button. Click it and do "Download ZIP":

**2.** Once it's done downloading, extract it, import the folder into your project, and wait for it to compile

**3.** Go to your URP asset and make sure "Light Cookies" are turned on
   
**4.** Navigate to "Tools > Light Cookie Generator"
   
**5.** In the Save Settings section, input a folder for the cookies to save to and a prefix for the light cookie's name

**6.** Just drag your light object(s) into the "Add Light" field or select all your light(s) and do "Add Selected Lights"

**7.** Do "Generate Cookies" (you can also do "Generate Previews")

**8.** Very crunchy

## Features
* ### Saving and loading
  * When a setting is changed in the tool, it will save to EditorPrefs
  * When a cookie is generated, the .meta that goes along with that file will have the data the tool needs to load that texture's settings
  * Pain in my ass to make

* ### Customizable settings
  * Drag in lights or add all selected
  * Button to clear all lights
  * Option to use spotlight range
    * If you don't use this, you can manually set the shadow plane's distance instead
  * Ability to set the opacity of the actual shadows in the cookie texture
  * Ability to set the overall brightness of the cookie texture
  * Set amount of samples anti-aliasing takes for each pixel (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x)
  * Use numerous methods for blurring (Penumbra blur is my favorite)
  * Set a blur radius
  * Set the amount of iterations blur goes through
  * Use Gizmos
  * Set a rotation offset for capture
  * Set a "capture size" for the texture (orthographic size)
  * Use a custom folder for output
  * Set a prefix for the texture's name
  * Set the resolution of the outputted texture
  * Make the cookie(s) also assign to lights

## Notes That May Be Useful To You Perchance And I Hope They Are But I'm Not Sure
* Tested with Unity 6.0 (0.58f2) and URP
* The GUI originally had two different modes, but I decided to just merge them (there may be some leftover variables and stuff in the code)
* You can only load settings from cookies (that were made using the generator)
* A resolution of 512x512 for the cookie is probably enough
* Only spot lights are supported
* THESE ARE NOT REAL COOKIES (sadly D:)
* Please leave a star so I can get GitHub famous
